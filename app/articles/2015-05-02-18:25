<p>Most large-scale deployments need to apply different&nbsp;settings, apps, or data to specific groups of devices. Common&nbsp;examples include grouping for separate student and&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;devices, grouping by specific educational course, and grouping by&nbsp;grade level.</p>
<p>Cellabus&nbsp;makes it easy to create groups of devices that&nbsp;can receive different policies controlling settings, app management,&nbsp;security restrictions, and device settings.</p>
<p>Simply create&nbsp;configuration profiles and assign these to groups of devices based<br />on device tags. Once groups have been created, adding hundreds&nbsp;or thousands of devices to the same group definition is as easy as&nbsp;tagging those devices.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine an iPad deployment needing three groups&nbsp;to segment devices: two separate grade level groups for student devices and one group for teacher&nbsp;devices. In Cellabus, all&nbsp;you need to do is create three tags &mdash; for example &ldquo;1st-grade,&rdquo; &ldquo;4th grade,&rdquo;and &ldquo;Teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, associate these tags with profiles that can be created in "Settings Profile"&nbsp;page in&nbsp;Cellabus. Any profile-specific policies would now apply to the<br />tagged devices.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps a profile created for students&nbsp;would include the the1st-grade and4th-grade tags, applying those&nbsp;profile settings to the student devices.</p>
