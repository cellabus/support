Every school or district has a catalog of pre-approved apps with Cellabus. <br><h3>To access the catalog, </h3><br>click on the <b>Apps</b> button on the homepage. Similarly, to see a list of ebooks click on the&nbsp;<b>﻿Ebooks&nbsp;</b>﻿button.<br><br><span><img src="/static/articles/apps.png"><br></span><br><h3>The Apps/Ebooks Catalog&nbsp;<b>﻿</b></h3>﻿shows the list of all apps/ebooks that your school or district has approved, along with available licenses for each app as well as any collection(s) that a particular app has been added to by another teacher in your school or district. If a particular app doesn't have enough licenses, you can request your admin to acquire more. Teachers can install free apps themselves, provided there are enough licenses. Paid apps need to be installed by an administrator.<br><b><br><span><br><img src="/static/articles/appslist.png"><br></span><br><br></b><h3><b><br></b></h3><br><br><br><br><div></div>
