Enrollment
<p>For devices owned by the school, Cellabus’ integration with Apple Configurator allows for better control over the device by having these devices “supervised” with Apple Configurator. In order to complete the following steps, you will need access to Mac OSX device. For fast and easy enrollment for multiple iPads simultaneously, we recommend using a mobile cart or locker.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Apple Configurator from the Mac App Store <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12</a></li>
<li>On your Mac, open the Apple Configurator &gt; Preferences pane; in the General tab, ensure that the checkbox against “Remove apps and profiles Configurator did not install” is <strong>unchecked</strong>.&nbsp;<img src="https://cellabus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201160445/1.png" alt=""></li>

<li>In the Apple Configurator Prepare pane, select the Settings tab</li>
