<p>Enrollment is now complete, you can now head to the Cellabus dashboard to manage these devices remotely. Login using your Apple ID to all the devices. The first time an app is installed using Cellabus, the device will ask you for the Apple ID password. From then on, everything will be over-the-air without any user interaction with the device.</p>
