In order for Cellabus to install apps on devices remotely, each device needs to have an Apple ID (iTunes Account) signed in on it. This is a one time setup and app installations after that don't require you to enter the password for the Apple ID. Furthermore, students won't be able to install apps on these devices themselves as long as they don't know the password.&nbsp;<br><br>All these Apple IDs need to be associated with your VPP account. Additionally, if you plan to install apps on teacher or staff devices, they can use their personal Apple IDs with Cellabus by joining your VPP Program.<br><br>1. Go to the&nbsp;<b>﻿VPP Accounts&nbsp;</b>﻿page from the side menu.<br><br>2. iTunes accounts can be added in two ways: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; i) <b>Add accounts in bulk</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Create a CSV file in excel or any text editor in the <a href="https://cellabus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202201189/valid_vpp_users.csv">following format</a>. <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"><i><b>Make sure you include the top header row</b></i>. The </span>client_user_id_str is for an account's Client ID.&nbsp;The <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Client ID can be any alpha numeric string, as long as each account has a unique Client ID within your school or district. This can be an email or even the name of the user.<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"><br></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. On the VPP Account page Click on the "Select file" button.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span><img src="/static/articles/vppuserimport.png"></span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Browse to the location of the CSV file that you created in Step (a), and upload the file.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d. Ensure that the right file is shown next to the button, and then click "Import from CSV" &nbsp;<br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span><img src="/static/articles/Pasted_Image_5_14_15__19_27.png"></span></span><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ii) <b>Add accounts individually</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Click on the "Add user" button<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://cellabus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201258849/Vpp1.png"><br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. On&nbsp;the next page, enter the email address&nbsp;of the user you want to assign app licenses to along with a Client ID. The Client ID can be any alpha numeric string, as long as each account has a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unique Client ID within your school or district. This can be an email or even the name of the user. Press register.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. The email address&nbsp;doesn’t have to be the same as the Apple ID, just a valid email address. The invitation in the next step allows the receiver to associate their own Apple ID without Cellabus or <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you having to know what that is. This is particularly useful for personal devices in a BYOD setting.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://cellabus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201339465/Vpp2.png"><br><br>
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d. You will be taken back to the VPP Account page, where you can now see the newly added account in the table.<br><br>Next <b>invite the iTunes Account to your VPP program</b>. <br><br>3. &nbsp; In order to do that, select the newly created user by selecting the checkbox and then clicking the “Invite User” button. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://cellabus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201339475/Vpp3.png"><br><br>4.
