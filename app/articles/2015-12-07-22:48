Common Issues
Administrators and teachers can lock devices to installed apps under the device tag pages. &nbsp;However, the list of available apps is the list of apps available on every single device. &nbsp;Therefore, if there are any devices under your tag which do not contain a given app, it will not be available to lock to. &nbsp;In addition, devices must have checked in with Cellabus (automatically done every night, or manually through the Device pages) for us to receive a list of installed apps. &nbsp;<div></div>
